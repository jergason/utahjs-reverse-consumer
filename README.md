# Utahjs Reverse Consumer

This is a teeny example app showing how to consume our [utahjs-reverse](https://github.com/jergason/utahjs-reverse)
module with browserify and npm.


It is just a simple react app that renders some text into a Reverse component
that we published to npm.


## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run-script build
npm start
```


This will install the dependencies, compile the javascript with browserify and
start a server running. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to
see our module being consumed in ALL ITS GLORY.
